## Concept Development and Design
- **Refine Concept**: Finalize the design details and functionalities.
- **Specifications Document**: Create a detailed list of features and required components.

## Sourcing Components
- **Components Purchase**: Acquire parts from suppliers like DigiKey, Mouser, or Newark.
  - **ALPS RK09K1130AP5**: Search on ALPS or distributor sites.
  - **CUI SJ-43516-SMT**: Available on electronic parts websites.
  - **ALPS SKHMQKE010**: Find on ALPS or electronics distributor websites.
  - **ROHM SML-P11UT**: Check ROHM's website for availability.

## Prototyping
- **PCB Design**: Design the printed circuit board using software like Eagle or KiCad.
- **Prototype Assembly**: Start with a breadboard to test the circuitry before permanent assembly.
- **3D Printing/Casing**: Design and print a custom case if needed.

## Software Development
- **Control Software**: Develop the necessary software for managing the E Ink display, WiFi, and HAM radio functionalities.

## Testing and Refinement
- **Prototype Testing**: Test all functionalities and fix any arising issues.
- **Design Iteration**: Refine the design based on testing results.

## Compliance and Safety
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure the device complies with local regulations, particularly for radio and wireless functions.

## Scaling Up
- **Manufacturing Considerations**: Explore options for manufacturing, from small-scale production to full-scale assembly.
